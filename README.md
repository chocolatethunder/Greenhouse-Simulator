**Created for:**  Introduction to Computer Science for Computer Science Majors II

**Description:** A green house simulator made using Java and Swing UI library

**Methodologies:**
- Test driven development (Waterfall Method)
- built using Eclipse IDE
- uses MVC Design model
- Use UML semantics to help plan, and design the software

**Overview**

The simulator was created to further understand the knowledge of the Java Swing library along with a gaining a deeper understanding of the Model View Controller Architecture in software design.

The program would take current environment setup of a simulated greenhouse and used a simulated thermostat, humidifier, and water sprinkler to try to achieve the preferred settings set by the user. The greenhouse would run a simulattion informing the user what each of the equipment was doing and the user could chose at what rate they want to refresh the data.

The additional ability to be able to load and save simulation data was added. So that simulations could be shared.
